## Advent of Nix 2023

This is my go at Advent of Code (2024) in pure nix.

### Running solutions

In general, `nix eval '.#dayX'` (where 'X' is the number of the day, padded to
length 2, such as `nix eval '.#day03'`) will display the answer to a given day.


### Day specific notes

#### Day 06

Part 2 takes an hour and 20GiB of memory to run on my machine.

I know there's a more optimal solution, but you know, it's fine.
